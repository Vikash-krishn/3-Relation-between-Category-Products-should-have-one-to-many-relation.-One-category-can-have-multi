 one-to-many relationship between Category and Product (one category has many products)

In Java (and OO generally) you'd expect the Category class to contain a list of Products, so the Category can be said to 'own' products.

In SQL it's the other way round - you'd expect Product table to hold a foreign key reference to a Category. 

Looks like your using JPA, so you could have something like this:

Category class:

@Entity
public class Category {

  //other stuff...

  @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="category")
  private Set<Product> products;

}
Product class:

@Entity
public class Product {

  //other stuff...

  @ManyToOne
  private Category category;
}
